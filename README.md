## Google Powered API Tradesperson Platform

### Introduction
This repository is showcasing my second milestone project for The Code Institute.

I have chosen to do a Google powered API Tradesperson platform for Google Places registered businesses/person and for those who are self-employed and who are not registered with Google Places. The reason I have come up with this project idea is to help people find the right business or person for a services that they require.

The reason I have chosen to pursue this as my second milestone project is that it will allow me to showcase skills that I have learnt from the previous project as well as new skills that I have come across and learnt. The list of skills being showcased in this project will be HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery and APIs.

The project will be fully responsive so that it can be viewed and accessed on all device sizes, but will also have that interactive element for users which will take it one step further from a static website.

# UX – User Experience

## The who?
The projects has a dual purpose, the first purpose is that it will help users find the right business or person that they require for a specific service who are registered to Google Places. The second purpose is that it will help self-employed people who are not registered with Google Places to advertise their services to users. 

When I say unregistered I mean a business or person who is not registered to Google Places, not in the sense that the business or person is not certified in that trade. So this project will help those who are not registered with Google Places to help them advertise their service and find work, not only through a friend or the spoken word but online using the Google Maps API.   

## The what?
The project will help users of the platform to find a tradesperson where ever they are in the world. It will also be a platform for businesses around the world, in cities, towns or even a small villages to advertise their services to users in the same area or around them.

## The how?
I will be using a variety of different technologies to create this project, the first and most important is utilising Googles API which are Google Places and Google Maps. To help the user search for a tradesperson a search form will be created that will allow users to select a country. Then a town or city they are in and then filtering the search further to a specific tradesperson not all at once. Once the search parameters have been inputted to then display the results to the user using Google maps with markers and also displaying the business or tradespersons info below for them to see.  

This part is for the registered business or person with Google, the second part will be for those people or business or are not registered with Google Places, this will be done the same way but the main difference is that it will be done manually and not utilising an API. The whole project will be responsive, it will also incorporate interactive elements and be fully accessible for all users. 

# User Stories
My users for this project are people who are in need of a tradesperson who require their service for an issue they are having or an emergency like a burst water pipe. The user could also be looking a quotation for a future project they are planning.

# Validation
In this section I have used a few different validation techniques to thoroughly make sure my project is fully compliant and accessible. I have used the W3C HTML5 and CSS3 online validation tools as well as an online contrast checker for the colours that I used in my project.

If there is any non-compliant code or warnings within the project I will document it and then fix it and this will be the first step of my testing and debugging.

# Testing
When it comes to testing and debugging I found it easier and good practise to test as I went along with my project and this can be seen in my git commit messages to my repository every time I pushed my completed files. The tool that I used throughout my project to help me with my test and debug was Google Chrome Dev Tools.

In this section I will test my project against my user stories and further text by doing some manual testing. These test will be done using a variety of different browsers and a variety of different screen sizes as well to ensure my projects compatibly and responsiveness.

# UX - User Story Testing
Here in this section I will provide a user story scenario with screenshot examples with steps if necessary to test my project against my user story.

### UX User Story Testing Document -> [Visit Document](writeup_files/testing/user_story_document.md)

# Further Testing
I have decided to further test my project by listing all features and functions within my project and then manually test each one. I will test my project in a variety of different browser to ensure it is fully compatible. The browsers I have chosen are Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Opera. I will test to see if all of the features and functions work as well as my font, images, hover animation and project responsiveness.

### Further Testing Document -> [Visit Document](writeup_files/testing/further_testing_document.md)

Throughout the whole project I developed my project on my Dell Inspiron 15inch Laptop and my Acer 24inch Monitor. I also used Chrome Dev tools whilst programming my project and used the responsive tool to simulate different device sizes. I also did some physical testing on a few devices such as my Samsung Galaxy S20+, Samsung Galaxy Tab 6.

# Known Issues And Solutions
### Google Maps API Freezes
This is an issue that I found early on in the development of my project, I found out that when I pushed the search parameters and made quick changes and fast searches the API froze and did not update because it could not find the info window icons and could not set them accordingly and the only way to get it working again was to refresh the whole page. To solve this issue I added a page refresh delay of a second so when the user clicks the reset button it clears the search parameters and then does a page refresh.

After speaking to my mentor, he then also suggested an if null statement to be added to the google search JS file to also refresh the page if the icons could not be set accordingly. After implementing the if null statement, I then added an alert window to inform the users that too many search request have been made and for them to click ok button to refresh the whole page, this solved the overall map freezing issue.

### Dual JavaScript File Issue
This was another interesting Issue that I had encountered, originally for my project I wanted all of my HTML on a single page in separate sections and then have my JavaScript hide and show each section. After achieving what I set out to do, I then encountered a script conflict specifically with my trade radio button. After trying to find a solution I then decided to separate my HTML code by creating two HTML documents. One document for my Google search and another for my Local search. After i had done this I then separated my JavaScript files and this solved the issue i was having.

### Accessing Modal From Multiple Pages
When I first created my contact modal, the only way I could access it was on the page the HTML code was written in and that was the homepage. After creating another page for my local search I then could not access it anymore. A temporary fix was to duplicate the code and have the same code in the HTML of the local search page. After doing some research I then found a solution in the bootstrap documentation, I needed to use JavaScript to help reduce the code by storing the body of the contact modal in a script. But still needed to have the contact modal HTML code present of both pages but not all of it.

# Deployment
## GitHub Pages
The first thing I did was I logged into my GitHub and created my milestone two repository. I used GitHub because of the wide variety of features it has like the version control, storage and deployment of my project. Throughout the whole project every time I made progress, made a change or fixed a bug, I committed to my milestone two repository with a commit message.

I deployed my project using GitHub and this was done by going to my milestone two repository settings. Once I was in the settings, I went to the GitHub pages section which allowed me to deploy my project live. Once i deployed my project, it was then provided with a live URL to my fully published website.

## Local Clone
Whilst i was developing my project, I ran my code locally by cloning my GitHub repo to my laptop hard drive. I did this by downloading the GitHub desktop application, once it was installed I was able to clone my online repo to my local hard drive.

I then used a text editor called Brackets to run my code locally and develop my project. With this text editor i was able to download an extension which allowed me to connect my text editor to my GitHub repo. With this I was allowed to commit, push and get file to and from my GitHub repo. The text editor also allowed me to download several plugins such as Emmet, Beautify and Markdown Previewer to help me develop my project.

The main reason I chose brackets over Gitpod is the overall interface and the wide variety of features it had to offer. The Live Preview feature that bracket has allowed me to view and edit my project live in Google Chrome without refreshing the page every time.

Another feature is the vertical split panel which allowed me to have two separate files open side by side to view and edit. Another feature is the file tree which allowed me create, rename and delete files easily. This also made it easier for me to switch between different directories within the repo and switch between other repos I have in my GitHub.

# Credits
## Content
Here in this section I have listed the various different types of content and code I used in my project. The majority of code and content has come from the Google Developers Map Samples. The biggest help and guidance has come from the Code Institutes lessons, challenges and video tutorials.

## Media
* Fontawesome Icons – All of the icons used in the project are from Font Awesome CDN which I declared in the head of every HTML webpage. (https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.14.0/css/all.css)

* Hover Transition – The hover transition was used from another CDN and again was declared in the head in all HTML webpages. (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/hover.css/2.1.1/css/hover-min.css)

* Google Maps - The Google map located in the homepage is linked to my Google developer platform account by using an API key that i generated when i created the account and has been declared in the script tags at the bottom of body. (https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyBY5zt-488Aq3MH-93TXudTj4sCSoa5N6o&callback=initMap&libraries=places,geometry&v=weekly" async)

## Code

## Acknowledgements
I want to acknowledge my student mentor Adegbenga Adeye for his helpful advice and guidance throughout the whole project. I would also like to thank the Code Institute for the course lessons, challenges and video tutorials they supplied. Lastly I would like to thank Stack Overflow, W3C School, Bootstrap, jQuery, the slack community and the other URL links that help my develop my project.

My inspiration came from The Code Institute Holiday Planner project located in the student project section of their website. When I first stumbled upon the project, I really like the whole concept and idea, so I decided to do some further research of my own to see if it was possible to do it for other businesses. Whilst I was doing my research I did find away on the Google Developer Platform documentation that the Google Place API can be used for other business types.

The reason I chose to base my project on tradespeople is that DIY is one of my hobbies, but at the time I was looking for a plumber to do some work around my house. The Overall development of this project was a challenge throughout but who doesn't like a challenge. I learnt a lot from developing this project and just how powerful and useful JavaScript can be.
